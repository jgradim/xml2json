h2. CHANGELOG

h3. v1.1 - April 18th, 2010

Added support for same name, ungrouped elements. Ungrouped sibling elements with the same name are converted into JSON objects with an appended number representing their index (starting with 1). This allows the transformation to preserve the original structure of the document without any data loss.

Example:

<pre><code><an-element />
<tag>a</tag>
<tag>b</tag>
<tag>c</tag>
<another-element />
</code></pre>

is converted to

<pre><code>...
{"tag1":{"$text":"a"}},
{"tag2":{"$text":"b"}},
{"tag3":{"$text":"c"}}
...
</code></pre>

h3. v1.0 - April 17th, 2010

First functioning version of the stylesheet, with support for text processing as strings or numbers, arrays, and special characters escaping (\ and ")
